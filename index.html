<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>HTML is a coding language used to create websites. It utilizes putting directions called "elements" into brackets called "tags". This can be used to put text, images, or links on to a website.
<br>I chose to take this class because I plan on majoring in Marketing and Graphic Design. I hope that by taking this course, I gain some basic knowledge on how to code and make websites to help me in my field. Plus, it also seems like a fun new skill to learn.</p>
